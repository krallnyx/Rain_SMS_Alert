# Rain_SMS_Alert
Script that checks if it will rains in the defined area and send you a SMS if it does

We are using Environment Variables, they need to be set via export OWM_API_KEY=xxx where xxx is your variable

If using a script, you can set the environment variables before the "python3 main.py" call, ending lines with
a semi-column

In addition to those 2 variables, you also need to set your latitude/longitude, your account SID and the phones number to use

This script is optimized to work on PythonAnywhere
